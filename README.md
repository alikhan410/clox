# Clox

Clox is a compiler for the Lox programming language, designed to facilitate the development and execution of Lox programs. This project is currently in progress.

## Introduction

Lox is a dynamically typed programming language with a simple and elegant syntax, inspired by languages like Python and JavaScript. Clox aims to provide a robust compiler that translates Lox code into executable formats.

## Features

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes Lox source code for easier parsing.
- **Parsing**: Constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokenized input.
- **Interpretation**: Executes Lox code directly for testing and development.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear and concise error messages for syntax and runtime errors.

## Installation

To install Clox, clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clox.git
cd clox
```

## Usage

Use this command to run the exiting file in the directry "code.txt"

```bash
make && make run
```

## Current Status

This project is in progress. Features and functionality are being actively developed, and contributions are encouraged!
